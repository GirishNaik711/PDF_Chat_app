# PDF_Chat_app
app.py: contains the code for the chat pdf
requirements.txt: has all the requirments of libraires and dependencies to build a chat pdf

In order to you run the code you'll have to use your Openai_api_key, by first storing it in a .env file and then load it in app.py

Have fun Eploring :) Thank you!
